# ChessTitans

A chess game I made that has 1 player and 2 player options (offline only, at least for now).

Features:

  Saving/loading: you can save and load as many games as you want.
  Board Display: there are 4 different visuals for the board and you can choose whichever you like (for now, you can only choose before starting or before loading)
  2D/3D: you can switch between 2D/3D view of the board while playing
  Levels: in 1 player mode, levels have bots with increasing intelligence. You unlock each level by beating the bot in the previous one.
  Undo: undoes the last move.
  Reset: restarts the game.
